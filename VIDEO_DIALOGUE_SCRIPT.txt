FHEVM EXAMPLE REPOSITORY - 60 SECOND VIDEO DIALOGUE
====================================================

Scene 1: Title & Hook
Imagine writing smart contracts where sensitive data stays encrypted... even while being computed. That's FHEVM.

Scene 2: Problem Statement
Traditional blockchains execute all logic with public data. Everyone can see everything. But what if you need privacy? What if users want to keep their financial information, personal data, or business logic confidential?

Scene 3: Solution Introduction
FHEVM enables Fully Homomorphic Encryption on Ethereum. Your data stays encrypted throughout computation. The blockchain confirms the result without revealing the values.

Scene 4: Live Demo
Here's a real FHE counter contract. Users encrypt their value locally. They send the encrypted data to the contract. The blockchain performs encrypted arithmetic. Results are computed without ever revealing the plaintext. Perfect for protecting user privacy at scale.

Scene 5: Use Cases
Use cases include private voting systems, confidential auctions, encrypted payments, and proprietary trading algorithms. All running on the blockchain. All maintaining complete privacy.

Scene 6: Call to Action
Get started with twenty-five working examples. Full documentation. Complete test suites. Visit our repository today and build the private smart contracts of tomorrow.
